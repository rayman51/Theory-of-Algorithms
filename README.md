# SHA256 Secure Hash Algorithm Program written in C

My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 4th year student in GMIT, studying Software Development.
For my Theory of Algoritms module, I was asked to create a Sha256 encryption program written 
in C using [VI editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) on a [Google Clould Virtual Machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/) running a [Debian GNU/Linux9](https://www.debian.org/) operating system.

### SHA256 Secure Hash Algorithm
A secure hash algorithm or SHA is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency. The reason for using this algorithm is to encrypt data so that the resulting output would be complete indistinguishable from the input data and would be very difficult to determine the input even if the output is known.

The algorithm shown here is the [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) algorithm. Its is a keyless encryption method as it does not use any form of key to encrypt the data, which technically means it is not an encryption, but actually a hashing function. It uses a one way compression format, meaning that it cannot be undone, or at the very least very difficult to undo the output or convert back to the original input.
