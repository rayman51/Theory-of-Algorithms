# SHA256 Secure Hash Algorithm Program written in C

My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 4th year student in GMIT, studying Software Development.
For my Theory of Algoritms module, I was asked to create a Sha256 encryption program written 
in C using [VI editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) on a [Google Clould Virtual Machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/) running a [Debian GNU/Linux9](https://www.debian.org/) operating system.
